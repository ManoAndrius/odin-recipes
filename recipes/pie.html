</p>



<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>8 skinless boneless chicken thighs</li>
<li>8 rashers smoked streaky bacon cut into large pieces</li>
<li>1 onion halved and sliced</li>
<li>250g baby button mushrooms</li>
<li>handful of thyme</li>
<li>sprigs</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan. Season the chicken thighs and fry for 5-8 mins until golden brown, turning occasionally. You may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan.</li>

<li>Lift the chicken onto a plate and tip the bacon pieces into the pan. Fry for 5 mins until crisp. Add the onion, mushrooms and thyme sprigs, then fry on a high heat for another 3 mins until the onions start to colour. Tip the flour into the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 min.</li>

<li>With the pan off the heat, gradually stir or whisk in the chicken stock, followed by the milk, then add the chicken back to the pan.</li>


<li>Bring to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins. Spoon the filling into a large pie or baking dish (approx 20 x 30cm) with a lip and leave to cool.
